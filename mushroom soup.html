                <p>Cream of mushroom soup is a simple type of soup where a basic roux is thinned with cream or milk and then mushrooms and/or mushroom broth are added. It is well known in North America as a common type of condensed canned soup. Cream of mushroom soup is often used as a base ingredient in casseroles and comfort foods. Featuring a melange of mushrooms, this hearty and comforting soup is a cold weather classic. It captures the pure essence of mushrooms, with earthy flavours enhanced by a drizzle of truffle oil</p>
